# Implementation of Sliding Authentication Form

## Completed Steps

1. ✅ Create `AuthContext.tsx` to manage authentication state, token, and modal visibility across the app.
2. ✅ Create `AuthModal.tsx` using Framer Motion for sliding animation from the side, reusing the auth form from `AuthPage.tsx`.
3. ✅ Modify `ProtectedRoute.tsx` to show `AuthModal` instead of redirecting to `/auth`.
4. ✅ Modify `useApi.ts` to trigger the modal on 401 responses.
5. ✅ Update `App.tsx` to provide the `AuthContext` and include the `AuthModal`.
6. ✅ Update `HomePage.tsx` to trigger the modal instead of navigating to protected routes when not authenticated.

## Summary

The sliding authentication form has been successfully implemented. When an unauthenticated user tries to perform a protected function (e.g., clicking "Add Your Recipe" on the HomePage), a beautiful form slides in from the right side of the screen, allowing them to login or register without leaving the current page.

### Key Features:
- **Sliding Animation**: Uses Framer Motion for smooth slide-in from the right.
- **Context Management**: `AuthContext` manages authentication state globally.
- **Modal Triggering**: Triggers on protected route access or API 401 errors.
- **Seamless UX**: Users can authenticate without page navigation.

### Testing Instructions:
1. Start the backend server: `cd backend && npm start`
2. Start the frontend server: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. Visit the homepage and try clicking "Add Your Recipe" without being logged in.
4. The auth modal should slide in from the right.
5. After authentication, the modal closes, and the user can proceed.

All changes have been implemented and are ready for testing.

## Additional Fix
- Fixed HomePage to prevent blank pages by removing the problematic HeroSection component from error, loading, and empty states. Each state now has its own full-page layout with proper background and content, ensuring the header and footer are always visible.
